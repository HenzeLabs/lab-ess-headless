## Phase 1: Pre-Deployment (T-24 hours)

### 1.1 Code Freeze

```bash
# 1. Ensure you're on main branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Verify working directory is clean
git status
```

**Expected:** `nothing to commit, working tree clean`

### 1.2 Run Full Audit

```bash
# Run comprehensive pre-deployment audit
npm run pre-deploy
```

**Expected Output:**
```
‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT APPROVED
All critical checks passed. Ready for deployment!

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Build Fails

**Symptoms:** Vercel deployment fails during build

**Fix:**
```bash
# 1. Check build locally
npm run build

# 2. If it passes locally, check environment variables
vercel env ls

# 3. Ensure all required vars are set
npm run verify:env
```

### Issue: 500 Errors After Deploy

**Symptoms:** Site returns 500 status codes

**Action:** **IMMEDIATE ROLLBACK**
```bash
vercel rollback [previous-url]
```

Then investigate:
- Check Vercel function logs
- Review recent code changes
- Test locally with production env vars

### Issue: Analytics Not Tracking

**Symptoms:** No events in GA4 Real-Time

**Check:**
1. Browser DevTools ‚Üí Network ‚Üí Filter "analytics"
2. Verify GA4 ID in environment variables
3. Check Content Security Policy allows GA4
4. Test in incognito mode (no ad blockers)

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify environment variable
vercel env get NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID

# If missing, add it
vercel env add NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID production
# Redeploy
vercel --prod --force
```

### Issue: Slow Performance

**Symptoms:** LCP > 4s, Performance Score < 70

**Investigate:**
1. Run Lighthouse: `npx lighthouse [url] --view`
2. Check bundle size: `npm run audit:bundle`
3. Review image optimization
4. Check for blocking scripts

**Fix:**
- Optimize images (WebP/AVIF)
- Lazy load below-fold content
- Review and minimize third-party scripts
- Check CDN caching
