## üß™ Post-Deployment Verification

### Step 1: Verify GTM Container is Live

**In Browser:**
1. Visit production site: https://your-domain.com
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí **Network** tab
3. Filter by: `gtm.js`
4. Check request URL contains: `GTM-WNG6Z9ZD`
5. Response should show updated container version

**Expected:** GTM container loads with published version

---

### Step 2: Verify GA4 Tracking

**In Browser DevTools:**
1. Open DevTools ‚Üí **Network** tab
2. Filter by: `collect?v=2`
3. Navigate through site (homepage ‚Üí product ‚Üí collection)
4. Check each request for:
   - `tid=G-7NR2JG1EDP` ‚úÖ
   - `en=page_view` ‚úÖ
   - Valid `client_id` ‚úÖ

**Expected:** All GA4 requests use `G-7NR2JG1EDP`

---

### Step 3: Check GA4 DebugView

**In GA4:**
1. Go to: https://analytics.google.com/
2. Navigate to: **Admin** ‚Üí **DebugView**
3. Open production site in another tab
4. Add `?gtm_debug=true` to URL (or use Tag Assistant)
5. Perform test actions:
   - Page load ‚Üí expect `page_view`
   - Navigate ‚Üí expect `page_view` (SPA)
   - View product ‚Üí expect `view_item`
   - Add to cart ‚Üí expect `add_to_cart`

**Expected:** Events appear in DebugView within ~30 seconds

---

### Step 4: Check GA4 Realtime Reports

**In GA4:**
1. Go to: **Reports** ‚Üí **Realtime**
2. Keep this open while testing
3. In another browser tab, visit production site
4. Perform user actions (browse, add to cart, etc.)

**Expected:**
- Active users count increases
- Events appear in event list
- Page views show correct paths
- E-commerce events tracked

---

### Step 5: Verify SPA Navigation Tracking

**Test Single-Page App Navigation:**
```javascript
// In DevTools Console
// Navigate: Home ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Collections
// After each navigation, run:
window.dataLayer.filter(e => e.event === 'page_view')
// Array should grow with each route change
```

**In Network Tab:**
- Each route change triggers new `collect?v=2&en=page_view` request
- Each request has `tid=G-7NR2JG1EDP`

**Expected:** SPA navigation fires page_view events

---

### Step 6: Verify Server-Side Purchase Tracking

**Test Checkout Flow:**
1. Complete a test purchase on production
2. Check GA4 **Realtime** ‚Üí **Events**
3. Look for `purchase` event with:
   - `transaction_id` = Shopify order ID
   - `value` = order total
   - `currency` = USD
   - `items[]` = product array
   - `client_id` = customer session

**Expected:** Purchase event appears in GA4 from server-side webhook

---

### Step 7: Verify Consent Mode

**Check Consent Mode V2:**
```javascript
// In DevTools Console
window.dataLayer.filter(e => e[0] === 'consent')
// Should show initial 'default' (denied) and 'update' (granted) on interaction
```

**Expected:**
- Initial state: `analytics_storage: 'denied'`
- After interaction: `analytics_storage: 'granted'`
- Hits only sent after consent granted

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Old GA4 ID Still Appearing

**Symptom:** Network requests show wrong measurement ID

**Solutions:**
1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Clear GTM cache (wait 5-10 minutes)
3. Verify GTM container was published (not just saved as draft)
4. Check GTM container version number incremented
5. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

---

### Issue: No Events in DebugView

**Symptom:** DebugView shows no events

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `?gtm_debug=true` is in URL
2. Check GTM Preview mode is **not** active (conflicts with DebugView)
3. Ensure GA4 property ID matches (check Admin ‚Üí Property Settings)
4. Check browser extensions aren't blocking analytics
5. Verify consent mode granted (check console for `analytics_storage`)

---

### Issue: SPA Navigation Not Tracking

**Symptom:** Only first page view tracked

**Solutions:**
1. Check AnalyticsWrapper is mounted (view React DevTools)
2. Check `window.gtag` is available globally
3. Look for errors in console
4. Test manual page_view:
   ```javascript
   window.gtag('event', 'page_view', {
     page_location: window.location.href
   });
   ```

---

### Issue: Purchase Events Missing

**Symptom:** Checkout completes but no purchase in GA4

**Solutions:**
1. Check Shopify webhook delivery (Admin ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Notifications)
2. Verify webhook endpoint returns 200 OK
3. Check server logs for Measurement Protocol errors
4. Verify `GA4_MEASUREMENT_PROTOCOL_SECRET` is correct in Vercel
5. Test webhook endpoint manually:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/shopify/orders \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -H "X-Shopify-Topic: orders/create" \
     -d '{"id": 12345, "total_price": "99.99", ...}'
   ```
