## 8. Risk Assessment ✅

### Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
|------|------------|--------|------------|--------|
| Unauthorized config changes | Low | High | Authentication + logging | ✅ Mitigated |
| CSV file corruption | Very Low | Medium | Git history + backups | ✅ Mitigated |
| Performance degradation | Very Low | Low | Load testing + monitoring | ✅ Mitigated |
| API downtime | Low | Medium | Env variable fallbacks | ✅ Mitigated |
| Bad configuration value | Low | Medium | Validation + easy rollback | ✅ Mitigated |
| Token compromise | Low | High | Rotation + IP allowlist | ✅ Mitigated |

### Overall Risk: **LOW** ✅

### Rollback Plan

**If issues occur post-deployment:**

1. **Immediate:** Revert to environment variables (automatic fallback)
2. **Short-term:** Remove API routes via deployment
3. **Long-term:** Git revert to previous commit

**Rollback Time:** < 5 minutes
**Data Loss Risk:** Zero (git-tracked)
