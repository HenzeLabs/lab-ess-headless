## üîê Security & Access Control

### Authentication Setup

**For Development:**
```bash
# Generate token
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Add to .env.local
echo "CONFIG_ADMIN_TOKEN=<generated-token>" >> .env.local
```

**For Production:**
- Generate secure token (32-byte cryptographic)
- Store in environment variables (Vercel, AWS, etc.)
- Rotate monthly
- Never commit to git

### Access Levels

**Current Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Read operations: Public (internal network)
- ‚úÖ Write operations: Token-based authentication required
- ‚úÖ All attempts logged for audit

**Phase 2 (Admin Dashboard):**
- Admin: Full access (read/write/delete)
- Editor: Read/write specific categories
- Viewer: Read-only access
